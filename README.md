# Scribus GIF Screencasts

A collection of short GIF screencasts for Scribus

## Notes

- use `key-mon`to show the pressed keys? (but, most of the time, we should not need it)
- how to store the files? using the same categories as the help? only its main categories?
- how to attach tags (for searching)?
- how to create a demo image that renders well in a Scribus screencast? (few colors available)
- use openshot to cut webm recordings? (ogv does not seem to be working)
- `xnee` allows to record the key strokes and mouse movements
